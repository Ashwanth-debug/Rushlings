# Rushlings — Decision Log

This file records decisions that should survive across Claude Code sessions. Add new entries when a product/technical choice materially changes implementation or prevents future re-litigation.

---

## 2026-08 — Build Rushlings, but validate it as an ugly local game first
**Decision:** Keep the Rushlings multiplayer vision, but drastically simplify the development path.

**Why:** A friend challenged the scope and suggested starting with something much simpler, similar in development complexity to a casual puzzle game. The useful insight was scope risk, not necessarily that Rushlings is the wrong product.

**Implication:** Prove the core loop with primitives, one human + bots and no networking/art before investing in production systems.

---

## 2026-08 — Godot 4.7.1 Standard + GDScript
**Decision:** Use Godot 4.7.1 Standard, not the .NET/C# build.

**Why:** Rushlings is a 2D game and GDScript is simpler, well-integrated with Godot and suitable for AI-assisted implementation.

---

## 2026-08 — AI-assisted workflow
**Decision:** Claude Code is the primary coding agent, connected to Godot through MCP. GitHub is the safety/checkpoint layer.

**Why:** The Game Director does not want to manually code/rig/build VFX or routinely use Terminal.

**Operating model:** Game Director directs/playtests; Claude plans/implements/tests/maintains docs.

---

## 2026-08 — Fixed straight-on 2D arena
**Decision:** Baseline gameplay uses a straight-on 2D side-view fixed camera.

**Rejected:** Isometric/top-down and scrolling-map baseline.

**Why:** The fixed side view preserves the core multiplayer value: everyone can see where friends are and what they are doing. It also reduces directional character-animation complexity and avoids a 3D/MOBA feel.

---

## 2026-08 — Entire arena remains visible
**Decision:** No camera scrolling in baseline mode.

**Why:** Seeing all players simultaneously is part of the product proposition, not merely a technical constraint.

---

## 2026-08 — Landscape mobile
**Decision:** Mobile-first landscape game.

**Why:** Better horizontal arena space and multiplayer visibility. Bottom screen space should remain clear for thumbs.

---

## 2026-08 — Minimal controls
**Decision:** Design toward movement + one power action.

**Current constraint:** No dedicated jump button.

**Why:** Game should be immediately approachable on mobile and not feel like a console controller overlaid on a phone.

**Validation needed:** M1 must prove contextual vertical traversal is fun enough. This may be revisited based on playtesting.

---

## 2026-08 — Simplify match to two phases
**Decision:** Baseline match has only:
1. Power-up/position phase.
2. Relic race phase.

**Rejected:** Multi-seal unlocking, four-stage objectives, and hold-the-Relic-for-10-seconds baseline.

**Why:** Those systems demanded too much explanation. The game should be understood in seconds.

---

## 2026-08 — Relic opens automatically
**Decision:** Relic is protected/locked initially and opens automatically after a short setup period (~25 seconds working value).

**Why:** Keeps early movement/power positioning meaningful without asking users to understand a seal puzzle.

---

## 2026-08 — First to touch Relic wins
**Decision:** Baseline victory occurs immediately when the first player reaches/grabs the open Relic.

**Rejected:** Mandatory 10-second possession/hold.

**Why:** Simpler mental model. Can revisit if playtesting reveals anticlimactic endings.

---

## 2026-08 — One power at a time
**Decision:** Player can carry one power. Touching a pickup collects it.

**Why:** Avoid inventory/ability-bar complexity and keep mobile HUD minimal.

---

## 2026-08 — Initial power set
**Decision:** Prototype the following powers:
- Push.
- Freeze.
- Teleport.
- Shield.

**Why:** They emphasize interfering with friends rather than conventional combat.

**Note:** Add/tune one at a time; remove any that are not fun.

---

## 2026-08 — No baseline elimination / ghost mode
**Decision:** Baseline mode does not eliminate players. Use short respawn.

**Previous exploration:** Defeated players becoming ghosts that manipulate the arena was considered fun.

**Why removed from baseline:** It introduces another rule/state before the simple game is proven.

**Parking lot:** Haunted/Ghost mode later.

---

## 2026-08 — Bots are first-class
**Decision:** First complete game should be playable as one human + three bots.

**Why:** Enables solo development/testing, reduces cold-start problems for future multiplayer and may later fill empty/disconnected slots.

**Technical:** Use normal game AI, not LLMs.

---

## 2026-08 — Tiny Relic Hunters as player character direction
**Decision:** Player characters are Tiny Relic Hunters (“Rushlings”).

**Character requirements:**
- Two expressive eyes.
- Strong small-scale silhouette.
- Large head/small body.
- Adventurous/mischievous.
- Hoods/horns/ears/helmets/scarves etc.
- Not tied to power classes.

**Rejected:** One-eyed/symbol-like main characters and generic mythical creatures as primary direction.

---

## 2026-08 — Masks are cosmetics
**Decision:** Ancient mask-spirit language becomes optional collectible/equippable masks rather than the only player-character form.

**Why:** Preserves emotional connection while creating scalable cosmetic identity.

---

## 2026-08 — Bright ancient mountain ruins world
**Decision:** Broad visual world is ancient ruined temples/civilization high in mountains, with bright sky/clouds/distant ruins.

**Why:** Earlier bright ruin concepts had better character readability and broader adventurous tone.

**Rejected as baseline themes:**
- Dense enchanted forest: characters became hard to find.
- Dark machine/forgotten kingdom: too dark/heavy/scary.
- Giant toy world: too child-oriented.

**Note:** These ideas can inform future arenas without replacing the broad world.

---

## 2026-08 — Multiple arenas within one world
**Decision:** “Temple” is an arena/region, not the entire game identity.

**Potential regions:** Mountain Temple, Water Garden, Sun Observatory, Cloud Forge, Broken Palace, Floating Gardens.

---

## 2026-08 — Art style can vary without changing gameplay structure
**Decision:** Future flat-color/painterly/pixel/high-definition style explorations must preserve the same fixed camera, arena layout and gameplay structure when being compared.

**Why:** Previous visual experiments accidentally changed the game format, making art-style comparisons invalid.

---

## 2026-08 — 2D production, not 3D
**Decision:** Do not require 3D character production for the current direction.

**Future production preference:** reusable modular 2D rig + in-engine VFX/procedural animation.

**Why:** Lower production complexity and better fit for tiny side-view characters.

---

## 2026-08 — Multiplayer networking is delayed
**Decision:** Do not implement server/backend/networking until local game is fun and polished enough to justify it.

**Why:** Networking is one of the largest technical risks and should not be solved before core fun.

**Future preference:** evaluate server-authoritative architecture at M8; do not prematurely lock Nakama/Supabase/custom solution.

---

## 2026-08 — Working name: Rushlings
**Decision:** Use “Rushlings” as the working product/project name.

**Why:** Stronger potential as an ownable character/IP name than generic Relic/Ruin descriptive names.

**Caveat:** Formal trademark/store/domain clearance must be repeated before brand investment/release.
