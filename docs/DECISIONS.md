# Rushlings — Decision Log

This file records decisions that should survive across Claude Code sessions. Add new entries when a product/technical choice materially changes implementation or prevents future re-litigation.

---

## 2026-08 — Build Rushlings, but validate it as an ugly local game first
**Decision:** Keep the Rushlings multiplayer vision, but drastically simplify the development path.

**Why:** A friend challenged the scope and suggested starting with something much simpler, similar in development complexity to a casual puzzle game. The useful insight was scope risk, not necessarily that Rushlings is the wrong product.

**Implication:** Prove the core loop with primitives, one human + bots and no networking/art before investing in production systems.

---

## 2026-08 — Godot 4.7.1 Standard + GDScript
**Decision:** Use Godot 4.7.1 Standard, not the .NET/C# build.

**Why:** Rushlings is a 2D game and GDScript is simpler, well-integrated with Godot and suitable for AI-assisted implementation.

---

## 2026-08 — AI-assisted workflow
**Decision:** Claude Code is the primary coding agent, connected to Godot through MCP. GitHub is the safety/checkpoint layer.

**Why:** The Game Director does not want to manually code/rig/build VFX or routinely use Terminal.

**Operating model:** Game Director directs/playtests; Claude plans/implements/tests/maintains docs.

---

## 2026-08 — Fixed straight-on 2D arena
**Decision:** Baseline gameplay uses a straight-on 2D side-view fixed camera.

**Rejected:** Isometric/top-down and scrolling-map baseline.

**Why:** The fixed side view preserves the core multiplayer value: everyone can see where friends are and what they are doing. It also reduces directional character-animation complexity and avoids a 3D/MOBA feel.

---

## 2026-08 — Entire arena remains visible
**Decision:** No camera scrolling in baseline mode.

**Why:** Seeing all players simultaneously is part of the product proposition, not merely a technical constraint.

---

## 2026-08 — Landscape mobile
**Decision:** Mobile-first landscape game.

**Why:** Better horizontal arena space and multiplayer visibility. Bottom screen space should remain clear for thumbs.

---

## 2026-08 — Minimal controls
**Decision:** Design toward movement + one power action.

**Current constraint:** No dedicated jump button.

**Why:** Game should be immediately approachable on mobile and not feel like a console controller overlaid on a phone.

**Validation needed:** M1 must prove contextual vertical traversal is fun enough. This may be revisited based on playtesting.

**Status — partially superseded (2026-09):** The "no dedicated jump button" constraint was superseded after Milestone 1 playtesting; see "2026-09 — Rushlings has a player-controlled jump". It is preserved here as history rather than deleted, because the validation it called for is exactly what produced the change. The rest of this decision — minimal controls, movement plus one power action, no console-style button layout — still stands.

---

## 2026-08 — Simplify match to two phases
**Decision:** Baseline match has only:
1. Power-up/position phase.
2. Relic race phase.

**Rejected:** Multi-seal unlocking, four-stage objectives, and hold-the-Relic-for-10-seconds baseline.

**Why:** Those systems demanded too much explanation. The game should be understood in seconds.

---

## 2026-08 — Relic opens automatically
**Decision:** Relic is protected/locked initially and opens automatically after a short setup period (~25 seconds working value).

**Why:** Keeps early movement/power positioning meaningful without asking users to understand a seal puzzle.

---

## 2026-08 — First to touch Relic wins
**Decision:** Baseline victory occurs immediately when the first player reaches/grabs the open Relic.

**Rejected:** Mandatory 10-second possession/hold.

**Why:** Simpler mental model. Can revisit if playtesting reveals anticlimactic endings.

---

## 2026-08 — One power at a time
**Decision:** Player can carry one power. Touching a pickup collects it.

**Why:** Avoid inventory/ability-bar complexity and keep mobile HUD minimal.

---

## 2026-08 — Initial power set
**Decision:** Prototype the following powers:
- Push.
- Freeze.
- Teleport.
- Shield.

**Why:** They emphasize interfering with friends rather than conventional combat.

**Note:** Add/tune one at a time; remove any that are not fun.

---

## 2026-08 — No baseline elimination / ghost mode
**Decision:** Baseline mode does not eliminate players. Use short respawn.

**Previous exploration:** Defeated players becoming ghosts that manipulate the arena was considered fun.

**Why removed from baseline:** It introduces another rule/state before the simple game is proven.

**Parking lot:** Haunted/Ghost mode later.

---

## 2026-08 — Bots are first-class
**Decision:** First complete game should be playable as one human + three bots.

**Why:** Enables solo development/testing, reduces cold-start problems for future multiplayer and may later fill empty/disconnected slots.

**Technical:** Use normal game AI, not LLMs.

---

## 2026-08 — Tiny Relic Hunters as player character direction
**Decision:** Player characters are Tiny Relic Hunters (“Rushlings”).

**Character requirements:**
- Two expressive eyes.
- Strong small-scale silhouette.
- Large head/small body.
- Adventurous/mischievous.
- Hoods/horns/ears/helmets/scarves etc.
- Not tied to power classes.

**Rejected:** One-eyed/symbol-like main characters and generic mythical creatures as primary direction.

---

## 2026-08 — Masks are cosmetics
**Decision:** Ancient mask-spirit language becomes optional collectible/equippable masks rather than the only player-character form.

**Why:** Preserves emotional connection while creating scalable cosmetic identity.

---

## 2026-08 — Bright ancient mountain ruins world
**Decision:** Broad visual world is ancient ruined temples/civilization high in mountains, with bright sky/clouds/distant ruins.

**Why:** Earlier bright ruin concepts had better character readability and broader adventurous tone.

**Rejected as baseline themes:**
- Dense enchanted forest: characters became hard to find.
- Dark machine/forgotten kingdom: too dark/heavy/scary.
- Giant toy world: too child-oriented.

**Note:** These ideas can inform future arenas without replacing the broad world.

---

## 2026-08 — Multiple arenas within one world
**Decision:** “Temple” is an arena/region, not the entire game identity.

**Potential regions:** Mountain Temple, Water Garden, Sun Observatory, Cloud Forge, Broken Palace, Floating Gardens.

---

## 2026-08 — Art style can vary without changing gameplay structure
**Decision:** Future flat-color/painterly/pixel/high-definition style explorations must preserve the same fixed camera, arena layout and gameplay structure when being compared.

**Why:** Previous visual experiments accidentally changed the game format, making art-style comparisons invalid.

---

## 2026-08 — 2D production, not 3D
**Decision:** Do not require 3D character production for the current direction.

**Future production preference:** reusable modular 2D rig + in-engine VFX/procedural animation.

**Why:** Lower production complexity and better fit for tiny side-view characters.

---

## 2026-08 — Multiplayer networking is delayed
**Decision:** Do not implement server/backend/networking until local game is fun and polished enough to justify it.

**Why:** Networking is one of the largest technical risks and should not be solved before core fun.

**Future preference:** evaluate server-authoritative architecture at M8; do not prematurely lock Nakama/Supabase/custom solution.

---

## 2026-08 — Working name: Rushlings
**Decision:** Use “Rushlings” as the working product/project name.

**Why:** Stronger potential as an ownable character/IP name than generic Relic/Ruin descriptive names.

**Caveat:** Formal trademark/store/domain clearance must be repeated before brand investment/release.

---

## 2026-09 — Rushlings has a player-controlled jump (supersedes the no-jump constraint)
**Status: ACCEPTED** after Milestone 1 iteration 2 playtesting. Jump, launch pad and wrapping were all played together and the movement model was accepted.

**Decision:** Rushlings includes a normal player-controlled jump. Prototype binding: Space, or W/Up when not engaged with a traversal zone.

**Supersedes:** the “No dedicated jump button” constraint in “2026-08 — Minimal controls”. That entry is kept as history, not deleted.

**Why:** This came from actually playing the game, not from argument. The Milestone 1 Movement Lab was built specifically to test whether horizontal movement plus contextual arena traversal was enough. It was not — it felt too restrictive for the game we are trying to create. The original constraint asked for exactly this validation, and the validation rejected it.

**Shape of the jump:**
- Grounded only, or from a ladder. No double jump, no wall jump.
- No variable/charged jump.
- Horizontal momentum is preserved through the jump; existing air steering applies.
- Tunable `jump_strength`, deliberately separate from and much weaker than `launch_strength`.

**Jump off ladders — ACCEPTED (2026-09, iteration 2):** while climbing, jump detaches the player from the ladder and performs a normal jump. A horizontal direction held at that moment carries them away from the ladder. The player cannot re-attach to the same ladder during that jump while the climb input stays held; releasing and pressing it again is treated as a deliberate re-engage. This keeps ladders from feeling like traps.

**Retained:** launch pads and ladders/contextual traversal both stay. Jump is normal player movement; launch pads are stronger environmental traversal that reaches places a jump cannot. Contextual traversal is no longer the *only* way to move vertically, but it is still how the arena creates route choices.

**Open question:** how jump maps to the minimal mobile control scheme (movement + one power action) at M5. Adding a third touch input must not turn the phone screen into a console controller. Not yet decided.

---

## 2026-09 — Horizontal screen wrapping (validated direction, under active testing)
**Decision:** The arena's left and right edges are not walls. A player that leaves completely through one edge re-enters from the opposite edge at the same height, keeping vertical position, direction and horizontal momentum. No fade, respawn, loading state, reset animation or spawn delay.

**Status: ACCEPTED** after Milestone 1 iteration 2 playtesting. The current behaviour — wrap once the body has left the edge completely, preserving height and momentum — was played and accepted as-is.

**Why:** It turns the fixed single-screen arena into a continuous horizontal loop. That suits the “everyone is visible at once” format, adds route and escape options, and costs no extra buttons and no camera scrolling.

**Intent:** This is part of Rushlings' arena-navigation language, not a debug convenience.

**Implementation notes:**
- Only the X coordinate is modified, so arenas with multiple vertical layers reuse the behaviour unchanged — a body wrapping on an upper layer stays on that layer.
- Anything in the `wrappable` group wraps, so future Rushlings, bots and objects inherit it without knowing the wrap exists.
- An `exit_margin` provides hysteresis, so a body that has just wrapped cannot immediately wrap back.

**Resolved (2026-09, iteration 2):** wrapping triggers on full exit. The alternative — wrapping when the body's centre crosses the edge, showing it split across both edges — was considered and is not needed. Full exit felt continuous in play.

---

## 2026-09 — Movement values are tuning data, not design constants
**Decision:** The numeric movement values produced by M1 — `climb_speed`, `jump_strength`, `max_speed`, `acceleration`, `friction`, `gravity`, `launch_strength` — are recorded as current tuning data, not as permanent game-design constants. They stay exported and easy to change, and are expected to move again as arenas, powers, bots and mobile controls arrive.

**Why this is worth writing down:** climb speed alone moved 260 → 320 → 400 across two playtests. Treating any of these as settled design would invite pointless re-litigation later. What is settled is the *model* — floor-only friction, preserved air momentum, grounded jump, latched climbing, full-exit wrapping — not the numbers inside it.

**Current M1 values:** max_speed 500, acceleration 3000, friction 3500, gravity 2200, jump_strength 900, launch_strength 1500, climb_speed 400.

---

## 2026-09 — Mobile control mapping stays unresolved until M5
**Decision:** How Run + Jump + Power map onto touch is deliberately left open until the Mobile Controls milestone.

**Why:** M1 deliberately used keyboard, and the prototype mapping (including W/Up doubling as jump outside a ladder and climb inside one) is a keyboard convenience, not a design commitment. Jump adds a third input to what was planned as movement + one power action, and resolving that on paper before testing real thumbs would be guessing.

**Constraint that still holds:** the result must not become a console-style D-pad plus button cluster on a phone. See "2026-08 — Minimal controls".

**Implementation note:** movement physics reads intent through three functions (`_get_horizontal_intent`, `_get_vertical_intent`, `_get_jump_intent`). M5 replaces those bodies with touch/gesture input without touching movement physics.

---

## 2026-09 — M1 accepted: the Rushlings movement language
**Status: ACCEPTED.** Milestone 1 — Movement Lab is complete, accepted by the Game Director after three manual playtests.

**Decision:** Rushlings' movement vocabulary is settled as:
1. Horizontal movement with acceleration and deceleration.
2. Player-controlled jump — grounded or from a ladder, no double jump, no wall jump, no charged jump.
3. Air steering, with horizontal momentum preserved in the air (deceleration applies on the floor only).
4. Contextual ladder traversal — latched, holds position with no input, ends level with the destination.
5. Jump off ladder, carrying any held direction away from it.
6. Environmental launch pads — automatic on contact, stronger than a jump, reaching places a jump cannot.
7. Horizontal screen wrapping — leave one edge completely, re-enter the other at the same height with momentum intact.

**How this was reached:** three playtests, each of which changed the design. The first rejected the original no-jump-button premise. The second added jumping off ladders and raised climb speed. The third accepted the result. None of this came from theory; every change came from playing it.

**What is settled versus what is not:** the *model* above is settled. The numeric values inside it are not — see "2026-09 — Movement values are tuning data, not design constants". The mobile mapping is not — see "2026-09 — Mobile control mapping stays unresolved until M5".

**Kept for reuse:** the Movement Lab scene stays in the project as a regression and tuning harness, not as a shippable arena.
